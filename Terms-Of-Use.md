Terms Of Use

By downloading or using GoWallet for AdMob, these terms will automatically apply to you – please read them carefully before using the app.

We are offering you this app to use for your own personal use without cost, but the app itself, and all trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to us.

You should be aware that you cannot send it on to anyone else, and you’re not allowed to copy, translate or modify the app, any part of the app in any way. You also may not attempt to extract the source code of the app.

We are committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. You agree that we may access, store and use any information that you provide in accordance with the terms of the Privacy Policy below.

We do not accept any liability for any injuries, damage or losses you may incur as a result of your use of the app.

We recommend that you do not jailbreak your phone. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that our app won’t work properly or at all.

We offer the app to you as-is and we are not responsible for the app not working at full functionality.

If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges.

In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.

We may update the app at any point in time. The app is currently available on Android and/or iOS – the requirements for both systems may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app.

We do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the version that you have installed on your phone.

We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device. This includes any paid functionalities or features.
